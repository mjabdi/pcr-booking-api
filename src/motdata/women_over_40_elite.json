            "high": "A high result on a CA125 blood test means that the level of the CA125 protein in your blood is higher than what is considered normal for your age and sex. This can be a sign of certain types of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, or other health conditions such as endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. However, a high result does not necessarily mean that you have cancer or any other specific health condition, and further testing may be needed to determine the cause of the high result. It is important to note that the CA125 blood test is not a definitive diagnostic tool for cancer or any other health condition. The results should be interpreted in conjunction with other diagnostic tests and clinical findings. If you have any questions or concerns about your CA125 blood test results, it is important to discuss them with your health screening doctor."
